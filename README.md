# 2D Vector-Based Tolerance Analysis with Monte Carlo Simulation and Machine Learning

This repository presents a comprehensive framework for simulating and optimizing manufacturing tolerances in 2D mechanical assemblies. Utilizing vector-based geometry, Monte Carlo simulations, and machine learning techniques, the project aims to identify and optimize Key Characteristics (KCs) that influence system variability.

## Overview

- The primary objective is to develop a 2D tolerance analysis model that:
- Implements a vector-based approach to analyze tolerance variations.
- Utilizes Python to create a simulation environment.
- Identifies the most relevant KCs affecting product performance.
- Conducts extensive Monte Carlo simulations with a large sample size.
- Analyzes the influence of tolerances on overall system variability.
- Trains an ML model to predict the most influential KCs based on input distributions.
- Optimizes the number of required measurements to reduce computation time while ensuring precision.

## Methodology

1. Vector-Based Tolerance Modeling
- Geometry Generation: Constructs a 2D representation of the tailgate-window system, incorporating rounded corners and defined gaps.

- Tolerance Definition: Establishes input distributions and tolerances based on real-world constraints.

2. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Sampling: Performs extensive simulations by randomly sampling input tolerances.

- Analysis: Evaluates the impact of these variations on the overall system, generating histograms and statistical data.

3. Machine Learning Integration
- KC Identification: Applies machine learning algorithms to determine the most influential KCs affecting system variability.

- Optimization: Reduces the number of required measurements while maintaining accuracy, thereby optimizing computational resources.

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Nihar2082/vector_tolerance_analysis.git
cd vector_tolerance_analysis
```
## 🚀 How to Run

### ✅ Step 1: Check if Python is Installed  
Most systems already have Python installed. To check, open a terminal or command prompt and run:  

```sh
python --version
```

### ✅ Step 2: Install Required Libraries

Open your terminal or PowerShell and run:

```bash
python -m pip install matplotlib numpy
```
🔹 **matplotlib** → Used for visualizing simulation results with histograms and plots.  
🔹 **numpy** → Used for efficient numerical computations in the Monte Carlo simulation.  

### ✅ Step 3: Run the Analysis

**1️⃣ Open your terminal or PowerShell.**
**2️⃣ Navigate to your project folder:**

```bash
cd "F:\2. MASTER THESIS\vector_tolerance_analysis"
```
**3️⃣ Run the analysis:**

```bash
python main.py
```
**This executes the complete simulation, including geometry generation, Monte Carlo analysis, and Key Characteristics (KC) identification.**

### 📊 What You'll See

✅ Tailgate & Window Visualization:

- Displays the system with red zones highlighting the gap variations in the tailgate and window.

📈 Gap Variation Histograms:

- Visualizes the distribution of width and height variations in the gaps, allowing for analysis of how the gaps fluctuate across different runs.

🧠 Key Characteristic (KC) Contribution:

- Printed output showing the percent contribution of each Key Characteristic (KC) to the total variation.

Example:
- Tailgate contribution to gap variation: 79.40%  
- Window contribution to gap variation: 20.60%  



### 🧩 File Descriptions

📁 config.py – The Settings File

Purpose: Stores all your important parameters in one place.

🔧 Contains:

Nominal dimensions (tailgate & window)

Tolerance values

Number of Monte Carlo samples

Gap size

🧠 Why it’s helpful: You only need to change numbers once here, and the whole system uses the new values.

📁 geometry.py – The Drawing Artist
Purpose: Visually draws the tailgate and window with gaps and rounded corners.

🎨 What it does:

Draws a rectangle for the tailgate

Draws a smaller rectangle (inset) for the window

Shades the gap between them using red zones

Adds labels like "Left Gap", "Top Gap", etc.

🔎 Uses: matplotlib.patches for custom shapes

📁 tolerance_analysis.py – The Simulator
Purpose: Runs the Monte Carlo simulation to simulate real-world variation.

🧮 What it does:

Randomly generates size variations (based on normal distribution)

Calculates the gap in width and height

Plots histograms to show how much variation happens

📊 Visual Output:

Histogram of width gaps

Histogram of height gaps

📁 kc_identification.py – The KC Detector
Purpose: Identifies which dimension (tailgate or window) is more responsible for variation.

🧠 What it does:

Uses variance analysis to compute how much each component contributes to gap variation

Returns results like:

Copy
Edit
Tailgate contributes 65.8%
Window contributes 34.2%
🎯 Helps prioritize which part’s tolerance to control more tightly.

📁 main.py – The Conductor
Purpose: Runs everything in the right order like a project manager.

🎯 What it does:

Draws the geometry

Simulates the tolerances

Shows histograms of gap variations

Prints Key Characteristic contributions

📌 You just run this one file to trigger the full analysis pipeline.

✅ Next Steps (Optional Ideas)
Add ML module to predict which tolerances are most influential

Animate the gap variation across samples

Export results to CSV/Excel for reports
